# 🧠 SoulMonitor — MLOps with Soul, Swagger, and Streamlit

Welcome to **SoulMonitor**, where model drift gets diagnosed with love, not latency 💥🍲

This repo is my remix of MLOps best practices — stripped down, affirmation-powered, and recruiter-ready. If you're tired of pipelines that feel like rocket science, SoulMonitor brings clarity, comfort, and clean deployment in under 15 minutes.

## 🚀 What’s Inside

> “MLOps is like DevOps, but with more data, more drama, and way more retraining.”

SoulMonitor covers the full lifecycle with a soulful twist:

- 🐣 **Project Setup** — virtual env, Git, DVC, and good vibes
- 📊 **EDA** — charts, outliers, and a sprinkle of intuition
- 🚧 **Data Pipeline** — ingestion, versioning, and synthetic noise (because why not)
- 🦾 **Transformation** — scaling, encoding, and outlier wrangling
- 🏋️ **Model Training** — multiple classifiers + MLflow tracking
- ✅ **Validation** — Pydantic-powered sanity checks
- ⚡ **FastAPI** — serve predictions with Swagger and swagger
- 🚢 **Docker + AKS** — containerized deployment with Azure flavor
- 🔁 **CI/CD** — automated builds, tests, and affirmations
